  "summary": [
    "RFC 9415 analyzes security and privacy implications of transient numeric identifiers in IETF protocols, categorizes them based on interoperability requirements and failure severity, and provides guidance on algorithms to meet these requirements while minimizing negative implications, aiming to assist protocol designers and implementers. It also examines real implementation algorithms for generating transient numeric identifiers and is a contribution of the Privacy Enhancements and Assessments Research Group (PEARG) in the IRTF."
